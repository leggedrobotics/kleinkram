# API Documentation
For each entity, the API provides a named controller, thus all requests are grouped by entity. The API follows the RESTful API design principles.

Available Modules are:
- [`auth`](project.md) - Handles the authentication and authorization.
- `access` - Handles access control.
- `user` - Handles the user related requests.
- `project` 
- `mission`
- `tag` - Shared for `Tag` and `TagType`
- `file` 
- `topic`
- `action`
- `queue`
