# API Documentation

For each entity, the API provides a named controller, thus all requests are grouped by entity. The API follows the
RESTful API design principles.

Available Modules are:

- [`project`](project.md) - Handles the authentication and authorization.
- [`access`](access.md) - Handles access control.
