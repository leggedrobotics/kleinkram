# Getting Started (For Developers)

This guide will help you get started with the development of the project. It will start with some instructions on how to
run the project locally and how to set up the development environment.

## Prerequisites and Dependencies

In order to get started with the development of the project, you need to have the following tools installed on your
system:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (for cloning the repository)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (for running the project)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (for running the project)

::: info Additional Tools
To enable code completion and linting in your IDE, you may also need a NodeJS, yarn, and python installation.
:::

## Run the Project Locally

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:leggedrobotics/kleinkram.git
cd kleinkram
```

2. Run the following command to start the development server

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

3. You can now open the projects frontend at [http://localhost:8003](http://localhost:8003).

::: info
The `--build` flag is used to re-build the docker images before starting the development server. See [official docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/up/#options).
:::

::: tip
A full overview of the project structure can be found in the [Application Structure](./application-structure.md)
documentation.

## Getting Started with Development

This section will guide you through setting up the development environment for the project.
In principle the setup works similar to running the project locally, however, there are some additional steps to take.

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the following command to start the development server

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build --watch
   ```

::: tip
- the `--build` flag is used to build the project before starting the development server.
- the `--watch` flag is optional and is used to watch for changes in the codebase.
:::

3. You can now open the projects:
    - frontend at [http://localhost:8003](http://localhost:8003).
    - minio console at [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001).
    - documentation at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

4. In order to enable code completion and linting in your IDE, you may need to install additional tools.
    - For JavaScript/TypeScript, you may need to install NodeJS and yarn.
    - For Python, you may need to install python and pip.

5. You can now install the dependencies for the frontend and the backend by running the following command in the
   top-level directory of the project:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

::: info
The application continues to run in the Docker container, the above command installs the dependencies on your local
machine. This is necessary for code completion and linting in your IDE.
:::

6. For installing the cli, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   cd kleinkram/cli
   
   virtualenv -ppython3.8 .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -e . -r requirements.txt
   ```


### Enable Database Seeding

In order to seed the database with mock data, you can run the following command:

```bash
# This will remove the existing database
docker compose down --volumes

# enable seeding by changing SEED in the .env file to true
sed -i 's/SEED=false/SEED=true/' .env

# This will seed the database with mock data
docker compose up --build --watch
```
